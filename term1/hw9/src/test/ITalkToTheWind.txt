[Verse 1]
Said the straight man to the late man
"Where have you been?"
I've been here and I've been there
And I've been in between

[Chorus]
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear

[Verse 2]
I'm on the outside looking inside
What do I see?
Much confusion, disillusion
All around me

[Chorus]
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear

[Verse 3]
You don't possess me, don't impress me
Just upset my mind
Can't instruct me or conduct me
Just use up my time

[Chorus]
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear
I talk to the wind
My words are all carried away
I talk to the wind
The wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear

[Verse 1]
Said the straight man to the late man
"Where have you been?"
I've been here and I've been there
And I've been in between
